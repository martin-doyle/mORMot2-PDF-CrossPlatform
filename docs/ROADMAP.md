# mORMot PDF Cross-Platform — Implementation Roadmap

Open work only. Finished work is in the git history, and the technical knowledge
it produced in `.claude/skills/` — this file repeats neither.

**State on 2026-09-22.** The engine is cross-platform, writes PDF 1.7, and its
tagged output passes PAC 2024 with one accepted warning (W-1, a Figure in
`pdf_demo`). Fonts are embedded and subset on all three platforms; tables carry
`THead`/`TBody`/`TFoot` row groups. All three platforms build, and `test_runner`
is green on each (222 assertions).

## Working Method

**One fix at a time.** Implement, verify, accept, then start the next. Changes
to `BeginStructContent` and the structure tree are unattributable when bundled —
a PAC error like "unbalanced marked content" then names no culprit.

| Role | System |
|---|---|
| Development, build, fast iteration | **Linux** |
| PAC 2024 + tag-tree inspection | **Windows** (only platform; mandatory) |
| Third-platform verification per change | macOS |
| `veraPDF --flavour ua1` | any; not yet part of the verification runs |

**PAC caveat.** The traffic-light status is not enough: a flat tree of
individually valid `Table`/`TR`/`TD` elements passes while the nesting is
broken. Always open the *Logical Structure* view as well.

**Toolchain.** The paths of the individual development machines are not part of
this repository; record them in `CLAUDE.local.md` (not versioned,
`CLAUDE.local.md.example` shows the format). A Lazarus installed outside the
distribution packages usually leaves `lazbuild` off `PATH` — use the full path
then. What holds regardless of the machine:

**Linux.** Linking the demos needs the GTK2 development symlinks, which
distributions do not always install: symlink `libgtk-x11-2.0.so`,
`libgdk-x11-2.0.so` and `libatk-1.0.so` to their `.so.0` files in a scratch
directory and build with `lazbuild --opt=-Fl<dir>`.

**Windows.** Target **x86_64-win64**; an aarch64-win64 FPC is not usable —
mORMot2 ships no static libraries for it. Build every project with `-B`: stale
`.ppu` files in `examples/*/lib/` outlive a unit-path change and will hide it.
Where the only `pdftotext` available is xpdf's rather than poppler's, there is
no `-bbox` — use `-layout` for column and line alignment. Without `pdffonts`,
`/BaseFont` survives as plain text in an uncompressed file, so
`grep -a -oE "/BaseFont[ ]*/[A-Za-z0-9+,#_-]+"` tells a subset (six-letter
prefix) from a whole face well enough.

**macOS.** Target **aarch64-darwin**. Linking prints a wall of `ld: warning:
object file ... built for newer macOS version (11.0) than being linked
(10.15)` — noise from the prebuilt mORMot2 units, not an error. HarfBuzz from
Homebrew (`/opt/homebrew/lib`) is on one of the paths `mormot.pdf.hbsubset`
probes, so no linker flag is needed; `hb-info` ships with it and is the
quickest way to tell a CFF face from a `glyf` one. Where the poppler tools are
missing, output is checked by file size and by reading the font dictionaries
with `python3` — inflating the object streams first, since the tagged demos
deflate `/BaseFont` out of reach of the grep.

**`--export` needs no display on macOS.** The Cocoa widgetset runs both GUI
demos headless; the `xvfb-run` advice is Linux/GTK2 only.

**Checking a change.** Build all six demos and `test_runner`, then compare the
PDFs with the previous run: file size, `pdffonts`, `pdftotext` output, and the
pages rendered with `pdftoppm -r 110 -png` compared pixel by pixel. A change
that is meant to be invisible has to come out pixel-identical. A pixel
comparison is valid **within** one platform only — see V below.

## Open

### V — Verification Outstanding

All three platforms build and pass `test_runner`. What is left is the
cross-platform comparison and the paths no pass has covered.

| What | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| Linux rebuild of all six demos | the R-15/R-15a/R-16 engine changes are argued to be POSIX-neutral from the `{$ifdef}` structure, not measured. Expect every PDF unchanged except `chinese_demo` and `rtl_demo`, which no longer pin the whole face |
| PAC 2024 on the macOS-built PDFs | the macOS pass checked sizes and fonts, not the tag tree; PAC runs only on Windows |
| PAC 2024 on `mormot_demo` | it ran on macOS (tag tree complete by inspection: 1 `Table` with `THead`/`TBody`/`TFoot`, 207 `TR`, 5 `TH`, 1030 `TD`), but has never been through PAC |
| Run on a machine **without** `libharfbuzz-subset` | `TestSubsetFallbackWithoutSubsetter` only simulates it by clearing `PdfFontSubsetter`; the loader path itself — missing library, or HarfBuzz older than 2.9 — has never run |

**Comparing the platforms — but not pixel by pixel.** The demos resolve
different families (Calibri/Cambria/Consolas, Liberation, Trebuchet MS/Georgia/
Andale Mono), so different advance widths, line breaks and page counts are
correct behaviour, not a defect. B-5 made the measurement platform-independent
*for one face*, not the faces themselves. What must match: `pdftotext` output,
the structure tree (roles and their counts), `pdffonts` (embedded, subset,
`uni`), page count and the PAC result. A true cross-platform render diff would
need a demo that forces one face on all three systems — worth building only if
this comparison is to be automated.

**`veraPDF --flavour ua1`** has never run. It checks PDF/UA mechanically and is
scriptable, unlike PAC's GUI — the objective half of the comparison above. R-15
made it more pressing: Windows tagged output is subset now, so the `/ToUnicode`
round-trip is carried by the subset rather than by a whole face.

Once all three platforms are green, that is the point for a first version tag —
the project has none.

### The Unused WinAnsi Peer Beside a CJK Font — unprioritised

The engine creates a WinAnsi peer beside every Identity-H font and emits a `Tf`
for it, but for a CJK face that instance draws nothing — the content stream
selects `F1`/`F3` and immediately switches to `F2`/`F4`. poppler reports
`Unknown font tag` for it. Pre-existing and unrelated to CFF (it appears on
files from before R-15c). The fix is to stop emitting the peer when it has no
used characters, which touches the font lifecycle on every platform — see
`fonts.md` §4 on the dual-instance model.

### R-15b — Symbolic Fonts Are Not Subset on POSIX — unprioritised

**Effort:** 0.5 day | **Files:** `src/core/mormot.ui.pdf.pas`,
`src/platform/unix/mormot.pdf.freetype.pas`

The one remaining difference between the platforms that is **not** a property of
the platform. `PrepareFontSubsets` skips a symbolic font when
`PdfFontSubsetter <> nil`: such a font reaches its glyphs through the `(3,0)`
cmap under the `F0xx` convention, and `AddToSubsetRequest` knows neither those
code points nor the glyph IDs behind them, so hb-subset would drop every glyph
the WinAnsi instance draws. Keeping the whole face is the safe answer there.

Windows does not need the exclusion since R-15a: `AddWinAnsiGlyphs` resolves the
characters to glyph indices through the face itself, which works whatever cmap
the lookup goes through. Aligning the two therefore means **improving POSIX**,
not restricting Windows — give `IPdfPlatformFont` a character-to-glyph lookup
(FreeType has `FT_Get_Char_Index`) and let `AddToSubsetRequest` fill the glyph
list on both platforms, then drop the exclusion.

Neither side is verified: no demo and no test uses a symbolic face, so the
Windows claim above is an argument from the code, not a measurement. Whoever
takes this should add a demo or test with Wingdings/Symbol first.

Related and equally untested: what `CreateFontPackage` does with a **CFF** face
on Windows. POSIX subsets CFF since R-15c; every face in the demos is
`glyf`-based, so the Windows CFF path has never run. Whether PDF/A or tagged
output impose extra `/FontFile3` conditions is likewise unchecked —
`chinese_demo`, the only CFF case, is neither.

### R-10 — Table Row Pagination — unprioritised

**Effort:** 2–3 days | **File:** `src/core/mormot.ui.report.pas`

A table row taller than the remaining page space forces a page break before the
row. Let the row split: partial cell content on the current page, the rest on
the next. The split row's cells have to stay inside **one** `TR` element
referencing both pages — `TPdfDocumentVcl.ResumeStructContent` does this for
text blocks (B-2) and is the model to follow.

### R-11 — TTC Face Index — unprioritised

**Effort:** 1 day | **Files:** `src/platform/unix/mormot.pdf.freetype.pas`,
`src/core/mormot.pdf.types.pas`

Only face index 0 of a `.ttc` is reachable, because `TPdfFontMap` carries no
face index. Add one so the remaining faces can be selected by name. The
FreeType backend already extracts a single face as a standalone sfnt
(`ExtractSfntFromTtc`), so the embedding side needs no change.

### R-13 — RTL Shaper Advance Test — unprioritised

**Effort:** 0.5 day | **File:** `tests/`

Linux fonts (Noto Naskh Arabic) resolve shaped glyphs through the CMAP, so the
shaper's own advance path never runs there — a bug in it is invisible on Linux
and fatal on macOS. Add a test against a font **without** Arabic presentation
forms. Background: `.claude/skills/fonts.md` §10.

`TestUseUniscribeIsPortable` (from R-16) is a compile-time guard, not an output
check: nothing yet asserts that shaped Arabic actually reaches the PDF. An
end-to-end test belongs with this item, checking the `/ToUnicode` entries for
`U+FExx` after drawing with `UseUniscribe` set.

### EMF/MetaFile and GDI+ Gradients — no work planned

Windows-only (`TPdfDocumentGdi`), not portable.
